# Diabetes-Prediction
This project is a machine learning model designed to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on various health parameters. Leveraging historical data and advanced algorithms, this tool aims to assist healthcare professionals and individuals in identifying potential diabetes risk factors.
Features

    Data Analysis: Utilizes a dataset of health parameters to train and evaluate the model.
    Prediction Model: Implements machine learning algorithms to predict diabetes risk.
    User Interface: Provides a simple interface for inputting health parameters and receiving predictions.
    Performance Metrics: Evaluates model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Technologies Used

    Python: Primary programming language used for data analysis and model development.
    Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
    Scikit-Learn: For implementing machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.
    Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization and exploratory data analysis.
    Flask/Django (Optional): For creating a web interface (if applicable).

Getting Started

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

    Clone the Repository:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/piyushxbhardwaj/diabetes-prediction.git

Navigate to the Project Directory:

bash

cd diabetes-prediction

Install Dependencies: Make sure you have Python installed, then install the required packages:

bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

Prepare the Data: Ensure that the dataset file (e.g., diabetes.csv) is placed in the appropriate directory or update the data path in the script.

Run the Model: Execute the main script to train the model and make predictions:

bash

python main.py

(Optional) Launch the Web Interface: If a web interface is included, you can start it with:

bash

    flask run
    # or
    python app.py
